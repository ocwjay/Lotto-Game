# Lotto-Game
A fun little lotto game created for practice.
I wrote this in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Rules
<b>Welcome to the Lotto!</b><br />
The Lotto rules are as follows:<br />
In the spaces under the six balls and above the play button, enter six numbers between 1 and 49.<br />
You get to start out with $200, but in order to roll the balls, you need to wager something.<br />
The wager must be 1 or larger.<br />
Once the wager is settled, the balls will roll. If your numbers match a ball, you make your wager back times 6.<br />
Basically, if you wager 10, and you get a matching ball, you'll make 60.<br />
When you run out of money, you can no longer play.<br />
Have fun!<br />

# Inspiration
I got the idea to do this from Idea Bag 2 for Android. I decided to make it my own in a number of ways though, and I put a lot of attention and detail into the UI.
